# Deep learning halos

This repository contains all the relevant code used in Lucie-Smith et al. 2020, "Deep learning insights into cosmological structure formation", https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201110577L/abstract.

A CNN takes as input sub-regions of the initial conditions of an N-body simulations and predicts the mass of the resulting halos as present-time.
